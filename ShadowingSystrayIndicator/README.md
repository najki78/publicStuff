# Monitoring Shadowing session on the remote machine
If, on the remote machine, you want the console user to be aware if the session is being shadowed (or when it has been shadowed for the last time), run the [ShadowingSystrayIndicator script](https://github.com/najki78/publicStuff/tree/main/ShadowingSystrayIndicator) on the remote machine. It will start a systray indicator, making it easy to notice if the console is being shadowed or not.


Interesting article on monitoring Shadowing sessions and (if needed) notifying console user about being shadowed (used in the script above):
