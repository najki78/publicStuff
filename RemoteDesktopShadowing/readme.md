# Remote desktop services shadowing (also called shadow session mode)
Remote desktop services shadowing (from now on *Shadowing*) is one of the lesser known [Windows features](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/19804.remote-desktop-services-session-shadowing.aspx) that enables connecting to the remote computer “console” using RDP. 

It allows IT personnel to view (and interact with) the remote desktop while letting the screen visible to the personnel behind the console.
Unlike _mstsc /console_, it does not lock the console view for locally logged on user, letting both local console user and remote user to see the console screen simultaneously.
